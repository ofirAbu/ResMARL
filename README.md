# ResMARL
Experimenting with different MARL algorithms trying to evaluate their resilience level.

Mainly building on top of the SSD domains repo: https://github.com/eugenevinitsky/sequential_social_dilemma_games

Specific additions:
1. Experimenting with agents that can communicate over the environment.
2. Experimenting with environments that are randomly perturbed over time.

simply running train.py will run with 2 communicating agents on the cleanup environment.
